## Overall Topic
Game Development and Design using the Monogame Framework and our original idea of the game titled "Office Crawler".

## What Have We Been Up To?
We have been learning the syntax, keywords, and prefered schemes of C#. At the same time, we have been teaching ourselves the Monogame framework, and the API surrounding it. Specifics about what we have learned include the event system in C# and various Monogame-specific calls such as `_spriteBatch.Draw();`

## Challenges
We have encountered many challenges. The event system in particular was very difficult to wrap our heads around. We also kept running into NullPointerExceptions that would nesitate a hard restart of the main computer.

## Next Steps
We believe that our next steps should include more playtesting to make sure that our gameplay prototype is fully valid. After that, restructuring of code and other refactoring will need to be initiated. Our current codebase is horrible, but works. That should change next, if and only if, our gameplay is engaging enough.
